**COMPOUND WORD FINDER**

This is a C++ program that finds the longest and second-longest compound words from a given list of words. A compound word is a word that can be formed by combining two or more other words from the same list.

**BRUTE FORCE APPROACH**
**HOW IT WORKS**

1.Reads words from an input file and stores them in an unordered_set.

2.Tries every possible way to split a word into two or more smaller words.

3.Uses recursion to check if both parts exist in the list.

4.Finds the longest and second-longest compound words.

5.Measures execution time.

**KEY FEATURES**

1.Simple Implementation ‚Äì Uses recursion to check word formation.

2. Basic Set Operations ‚Äì Uses unordered_set for quick word lookups.
  
3. No Sorting Required ‚Äì Directly checks each word without pre-processing.
  
4. Performance Tracking ‚Äì Measures processing time in microseconds (¬µs).

**TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY**

1.Time Complexity: O(N * 2^L) 

2.Space Complexity: O(N) 

**OPTIMIZED APPROACH**
**HOW IT WORKS**

1.Reads words from an input file and stores them in an unordered_set for quick lookups.

2.Sorts the words by length (longest first) so the longest compound word is found first.

3.Uses Dynamic Programming (DP) to check if a word can be formed by joining smaller words from the list.

4.Finds and prints the longest and second-longest compound words, along with the time taken to process them.

**KEY FEATURES**

1.Fast Execution ‚Äì Uses an unordered_set for quick word lookups.

2.Efficient Sorting ‚Äì Checks longest words first to find results faster.

3.Dynamic Programming (DP) ‚Äì Optimized approach to check if words can be formed from others.

4.Performance Tracking ‚Äì Measures processing time in microseconds (¬µs).

6.Recursive Stack Issues	                  üö® Stack overflow for large inputs              	‚úÖ No recursion, uses DP

7.Performance on Large Inputs	              ‚ùå Very slow	                                    ‚úÖ Fast and scalable

**CONCLUSION**

1.If the dataset is small, brute force can work.

2. If the dataset is large, the optimized approach is much better.
3. 
4. For real-world applications, always use the optimized approach.
